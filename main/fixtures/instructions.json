Fields, the domino-shaped rectangles, produce goods every period. Each period has two phases, a #production_length# second \"production\" phase and a #move_length# second \"move\"<em> </em>phase. During the production phase, goods will grow in the fields. You and the other participants can move the produced goods during the move phase. The experiment will have many periods.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">We will describe how this process works next.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Continue to the next page of the instructions by pressing the<strong> </strong><span style=\"background-color: #0d6efd; color: #ffffff;\">Next <span class=\"far fa-arrow-alt-circle-right\">&nbsp;</span></span><strong>&nbsp;</strong>button.</span></p>", "page_number": 1, "timestamp": "2022-01-03T19:12:53.970Z", "updated": "2022-01-05T19:37:15.921Z"}}, {"model": "main.instruction", "pk": 2, "fields": {"instruction_set": 1, "text_html": "<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Move Phase</span></strong></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">After the production phase is complete, the #move_length# second move<em>&nbsp;</em>phase will begin.
